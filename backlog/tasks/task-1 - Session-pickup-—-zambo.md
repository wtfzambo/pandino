## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
WHERE WE LEFT OFF
2026-09-28. Branch `main`; TASK-18 is Done with all five acceptance criteria checked. Implementation commit `2f856a2` (feat: bound reviewer effort and incremental follow-ups) is published on origin/main; push and clean working tree were verified. This closing update touches only TASK-18 publication notes and this pickup snapshot; its handoff commit and push complete the session. Current policy: reviewer turn defaults 20/40, explicit 8-turn correction calls, incremental follow-ups, bounded investigation, and partial verdicts at exhaustion. See TASK-18 for evidence, doc-3 for current behavior, and decision-7 for rationale. No implementation work remains active. Existing ignored local .pi agents and downstream installations were not updated.

WHAT'S NEXT
1. When the user requests adoption in an existing project, run its `.pandino/check-update` and follow the README update/merge-candidate flow. Preserve saved model choices.
2. Calibrate the 20/40/8 defaults from future real reviews when evidence warrants it. This completed slice needs no further review or unsolicited benchmark sweep.

WAITING ON / GATED BY
Nothing blocks Pandino as of 2026-09-28. The user approved and requested publication. Downstream adoption remains a separate user choice. Hard abort after grace and workflow inheritance were source-inspected; native wrap-up and the closed-finding/new-regression probe were exercised.

VERIFY
`git status -sb` should be clean and synchronized with origin/main. `git log --oneline -2` should show the closing handoff commit above implementation commit2f856a2; `git ls-remote --heads origin main` should match local HEAD. TASK-18 is Done with all criteria checked. Installer and benchmark harness suites, shell syntax, and diff hygiene passed; the closing update changes only Backlog metadata/text. `bash tests/test_review_bench.sh` intentionally prints one fake-provider failure before PASS. No time, tool-count, token or cost guarantee is claimed by the turn limits.

## WHERE WE LEFT OFF

**2026-08-05.** Branch `main` at `c5e3bc6`, pushed, working tree clean.
Public repo: https://github.com/wtfzambo/pandino

Pandino is complete and self-hosting: it installs into a repo, and this repo
uses its own output. Nothing is half-finished.

What the session produced, on top of the original kit:

- **Model benchmarks.** `bench/implementer/` (4 tasks x 4 models x 3 runs) and
  `bench/review/` (4 tasks x 10 models x 3 runs). Reviewer runs are scored by an
  LLM judge, `bench/review/judge.py`, overridable with `BENCH_JUDGE_MODEL`.
  Results and the reasoning behind them are in `NOTES.md`; the routing verdicts
  landed in the agent frontmatter — `gpt-5.6-terra` for the implementer,
  `deepseek-v4-flash` for both reviewers. Raw `.jsonl` transcripts are
  gitignored, everything else under `results/` is committed, including the code
  each implementer run produced (`results/artifacts/`, rebuilt by
  `extract_artifacts.py`).
- **Installer.** Interactive when a terminal is attached, silent for agents and
  CI. Four questions up front — Backlog.md, parallel-agent notes, i-have-adhd,
  and an arrow-key picker for which editors get the agents — then it runs
  uninterrupted and ends with a recap of what landed. Reachable through the
  curl one-liner in the README.
- **Four harnesses.** `harnesses.sh` translates `agents/*.md` into each tool's
  format: pi, Claude Code, opencode, Codex. The kit files stay the single source
  of truth; only the wrapper differs. Symlinks were tried and rejected —
  opencode refuses pi's frontmatter outright.
- **AGENTS.md.** Gained the agent-workflow section: plan, delegate to the
  implementer, run both reviewers, then verify the integrated result yourself,
  plus the note that a plan's author is its least neutral judge.
- **Backlog.** Initialised here in this session, which is what created this task.

## WHAT'S NEXT

Nothing is blocking. Pick from:

1. **Use the workflow on itself.** The next non-trivial change to Pandino should
   go through the `implementer` agent and both reviewers rather than direct
   edits. It has never been exercised on this repo.
2. **Harder reviewer benchmark.** The current tasks are single-file with four
   planted defects, which is why every model except Haiku scored full marks on
   spec review. A multi-file diff with cross-file spec tracing would separate
   them. Full follow-up list at the bottom of `NOTES.md`.
3. **Regenerate the benchmark prompts if the agents change.**
   `bench/implementer/implementer-prompt.md` and `bench/review/prompts/` are
   snapshots of `agents/*.md` with the frontmatter stripped. Stale copies would
   benchmark the wrong prompt.

## WAITING ON / GATED BY

Nothing. No pending decision, no external dependency, no unanswered question.

## VERIFY

```bash
git log --oneline -1               # expect c5e3bc6
git status -sb                     # expect clean, main in sync with origin
bash tests/test_install.sh         # expect: test_install.sh: PASS
python3 bench/implementer/summarize.py   # 16 rows of medians
python3 bench/review/summarize.py        # 40 rows of medians
```

A real install, into a throwaway directory:

```bash
d=$(mktemp -d) && git -C "$d" init -q && ./install.sh "$d" --no-input
grep -c 'pandino:' "$d/AGENTS.md"  # expect 0: only the core ships
```
